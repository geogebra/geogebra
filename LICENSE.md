# GeoGebra License

You are free to copy, distribute and transmit GeoGebra for **non-commercial** purposes (please see details below).

## Guidelines to distinguish Non-commercial and Commercial Use

You may only use the GeoGebra Software and Materials under the terms of a relevant license agreement. The license agreement which applies to you depends on your use of the Software and the Materials, which can be summarised as follows:

- You are free to copy, distribute and transmit GeoGebra for non-commercial purposes. Non-commercial use is subject to the terms of our **GeoGebra Non-Commercial License Agreement**.
- Any use of GeoGebra for a **commercial purpose** is subject to and requires a special license. If you intend to use GeoGebra for a commercial purpose, please contact **office@geogebra.org** to arrange a License and Collaboration Agreement with us.

Whether a particular use of the GeoGebra Materials is "non-commercial" depends on the use, not the user, and to assist we have set out the notes below:

1. **Non-commercial Use**. We anticipate that non-commercial use will primarily involve students and teachers who may wish to use GeoGebra at home and in school or university for the purposes of their school or academic study and teaching, without intending to seek any commercial advantage or financial gain. This includes teachers in schools and universities where tuition fees are charged, so long as the use of GeoGebra is limited to personal or individual classroom teaching.
2. **Commercial Use**. We anticipate that commercial use will primarily involve publishers, online schools, online universities and non-profit organizations who wish to use GeoGebra to support activities that are intended toward securing a commercial advantage or the generation of revenue or monetary compensation.

Examples of commercial use might include:

- use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) to generate or develop educational materials or resources which will be sold in exchange for a fee (including course or tuition fees) or (if given away for free) which are used to gain a commercial advantage for the user;
- the provision of training, support or editorial services that use or reference GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) in exchange for a fee;
- use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) within a non-academic ebook, textbook or journal, whether or not the book or journal is distributed for a fee. Please note that academic papers and conferences do not require a License and Collaboration Agreement; and
- use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) to assist in securing advertising or sponsorship type revenues.

## GeoGebra License FAQ

### What exactly is the GeoGebra software?

When we refer to 'GeoGebra' software or as a product, we are really referring to a number of component parts which together form the working GeoGebra software program. The most important of these constituent parts are:

- the Java source code, which forms the heart of the software program, allowing for GeoGebra's interactive functionality;
- the installers (which bundle the source code, our language and other documentation files for use on various operating systems) and web services (such as GeoGebra Materials platform). The installers allow you to install the software on your computer or use it through your internet browser; and
- the language files, which allow you to enjoy the functionality of our software in many different languages. The language files are an independent add-on to our software and GeoGebra can work without them.

These distinctions are important when considering how GeoGebra is **licensed**, as these constituent parts are made available under different licenses.

### How is GeoGebra licensed?

We license the different component parts of GeoGebra differently depending on their origin (authorship) and depending on your intended use of GeoGebra (see also next question)

- the source code is licensed under the GNU General Public License to ensure consistency with the various other pieces of software and libraries which are used within the GeoGebra source code (for a complete list of which see: https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:Sources_For_Used_Libraries).
- the GeoGebra installers (for various platforms including Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS) and our web services (including GeoGebra Materials platform) are made available under our own **licensing terms** which have been drafted by an experienced law firm. We allow you to use the installers and web services for non-commercial purposes only provided you acknowledge GeoGebra; and
- the GeoGebra language files are made available under a Creative Commons license, which allows non-commercial use of these files.

Thus, there are really many different licenses involved in the background.

### Who can use GeoGebra free of charge?

GeoGebra and our web services are made available **free of charge for non-commercial users**. Most of our users are students and teachers and they usually fall under our non-commercial license, allowing them to use and distribute GeoGebra and related materials free of charge at home and in school.

Commercial users pay a moderate license fee, which helps us to continually improve GeoGebra and keep it free for non-commercial users. Please see **some examples** on how we distinguish non-commercial and commercial use. If you are not sure whether your use is commercial or not, please just get in touch with us at office@geogebra.org.

### Is GeoGebra free and open source software?

GeoGebra is open source software and available **free of charge for non-commercial users**. You can find our **source code online** and we are actively collaborating with the open source community and **other open source projects** used by GeoGebra. Thanks a lot to all contributors of these projects for their great work!

Please note that GeoGebra as a complete software program would probably not be considered "free" software according to the definition of that term which is used by the Free Software Foundation. This is because the restrictions on commercial use that apply to the GeoGebra installers, web services and language files add-ons might be seen to be a restriction on the software as a whole (thus making it "non-free"), even though the GeoGebra source code is made available under the GNU General Public License without restriction. You can rest assured that our license terms fully respect all existing licenses from third parties (including the GNU General Public License and all Creative Commons variants) and have been checked by an experienced law firm.

Most importantly, GeoGebra will always continue to be available free of charge for students and teachers for all major operating systems. We are also providing installers of our latest versions for the main Linux distributions (these are available to download from **the wiki**).

The GeoGebra Group is dedicated to the open source movement and collaboration with members of the FOSS community â€“ please get in touch with us at office@geogebra.org if you'd like to help us make GeoGebra even better.
