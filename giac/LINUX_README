This short tutorial explains how to create a command line driven Linux
version of Giac. The steps below have been tested under Linux Mint 17.2,
Ubuntu Linux 14.04 16.04 and 18.04.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install the packages build-essential, libgmp-dev and libmpfr-dev.

Compilation and running
-----------------------

1. Enter

   $ ../gradlew run

2. After a successful compilation you should see something like

   Press CTRL-D to stop
   > Building 85% > :run

   Here you can type some examples and exit with CTRL-D.

Troubleshooting
---------------

You may want to remove the line "include giac-android" from the file
settings.gradle in order to avoid installing the whole Android SDK.
Also remove the tasks "androidCopyCrystaxSo" and "androidAar" from
the file build.gradle.

Alternatively, you can completely remove the file settings.gradle.
Also, the file ../settings.gradle should be removed for Gradle 5.x.

If you used git to check the source out, you need to put a symlink
on ../gradle-scripts/.

Debugging in an IDE
-------------------

Use CLion to import the file CMakeLists.txt. Then put breakpoints to
various points you like (you may start with minigiac.cc).
