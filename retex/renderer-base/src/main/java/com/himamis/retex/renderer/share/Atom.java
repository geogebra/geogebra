/**
 * An abstract superclass for all logical mathematical constructions that can be
 * a part of a TeXFormula. All subclasses must implement the abstract
 * {@link #createBox(TeXEnvironment)} method that transforms this logical unit
 * into a concrete box (that can be painted). They also must define their type,
 * used for determining what glue to use between adjacent atoms in a
 * "row construction". That can be one single type by asigning one of the type
 * constants to the {@link #type} field. But they can also be defined as having
 * two types: a "left type" and a "right type". This can be done by implementing
 * the methods {@link #getLeftType()} and {@link #getRightType()}. The left type
 * will then be used for determining the glue between this atom and the previous
 * one (in a row, if any) and the right type for the glue between this atom and
 * the following one (in a row, if any).
