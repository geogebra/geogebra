GeoGebra - Dynamic Mathematics for Everyone
http://www.geogebra.org/

This directory definitely contains the "desktop" and the "web" versions
of GeoGebra. The "common" directory contains the common parts for the
two interfaces. Also the "mobile" version takes place in the "mobile"
folder, but it is based on the "web" and the "common" projects. The
"iwb" folder contains the sources for the Smart Interactive Whiteboard
version, based on the "desktop" version. The folders "jogl1" and "jogl2"
contain source files for the OpenGL subsystem for the "desktop" version
(for GeoGebra 5.0).

For compiling, running and installing the "desktop" version, please read
http://dev.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/SetUp.

To compile and run the "web" version, please read
http://dev.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/Web#Compilation.

To compile the "mobile" version, please read the file mobile/README.txt.

The "app" directory contains wrapper applications for various platforms.

The "test" directory is for testing GeoGebra internals.
