How to create a benchmarking server which periodically (daily) tests the prover subsystem in GeoGebra
=====================================================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

* Ubuntu Linux 14.10 or Linux Mint 17.2 (other Linux systems may also work)

* Superuser (sudo) privileges

* The following extra packages:

  * Jenkins (suggested installation from http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/)
  * authbind (configure as described at http://stackoverflow.com/a/9331030 but use port 443 instead of 80)
  * xvfb (as standard Linux package)
  * PhantomJS (from http://phantomjs.org/, see also http://phantomjs.org/build.html, version 2.0.0 is
    the minimum requirement) if you are interested in testing the web version also (by default it is
    included)

  * sqlite3 (for SQL based testing, yet under construction)

Start Jenkins
-------------

* Change /etc/default/jenkins to use HTTPS_PORT=443 and update the script accordingly

* You may need to add the jenkins user to the group shadow in /etc/group (bug in Jenkins ver. 1.629)

* Restart Jenkins by entering

  $ sudo service restart jenkins

* Configure Jenkins and go to Configure Global Security -> Check Enable security,
  Security Realm -> Select Unix user/group database, Authorization -> Logged-in users can do anything,
  then Save

Configure Jenkins
-----------------

* Log in as your normal Unix user at https://your.ip.address to Jenkins

* Go to the Plugin/Update menu -> Available tab, and install the following plugins:

  * Gradle plugin
  * Xvfb plugin
  * Environment injector plugin

* Go to Configure System -> Xvfb installation -> Add Xvfb installation -> Name, enter xvfb-run

* Create a New Item "GeoGebra-provertest" (without quotes, make sure that you don't use spaces in the name)
  as a freestyle project, then

  * Select Subversion as Version Control System and http://dev.geogebra.org/svn/trunk/geogebra as Repository URL

  * At Build Triggers -> Poll SCM choose a cron-formatted schedule scenario, maybe "0 10 * * *" (without quotes)
    to start building GeoGebra at 10:00 every day

  * At Build Environment -> check Start Xvfb before the build, and shut it down after,
    then enter 1024x768x24 for Xvfb setting. Next, check
    Inject environment variables to the build process, and enter DEVMODULES=all
    to Properties Content

  * At Build -> check Use Gradle Wrapper, and enter
    ":desktop:installDist :web:clean :web:draftCompileGwt :web:draftSymlinkIntoWar" (without quotes) for Tasks,
    if you have less resources you may omit :web:clean to speed up compilation (but in some cases it may
    be mandatory due to a bug in a Gradle plugin)

  * Click Add build step -> Execute shell, and enter "cd test/scripts/benchmark/prover && ./runtests-all && ./check-all"
    (without quotes) as Command

  * At Post-build Actions -> Archive the artifacts -> Files to archive enter
    "test/scripts/benchmark/prover/html/**" (without quotes)

  * Click Save

Running the benchmark
---------------------

This should be automatic, but you can start a new build on demand also in Jenkins manually.
