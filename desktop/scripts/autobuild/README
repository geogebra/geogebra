These files are for automated or manual server-side builds using
Subversion via HTTP (or the local file system).

Usage:

If you want to compile GeoGebra for testing purposes, then you may want to
run the ./make-vanilla-jars script only.

If you want to create a GeoGebra release, then do the following:

1. Copy autobuild.conf.dist to autobuild.conf and edit the latter as needed.

2. Run ./checkout to create a working copy of the repository (this step
   is needed only once, but probably it is already done --- if not,
   make sure that all relevant steps are run from that script). On demand
   another run can be done, it is harmless to do it again later.

3. Please use the new build system in ../../../../tools/build
   and use the scripts in platforms/desktop/official/.
