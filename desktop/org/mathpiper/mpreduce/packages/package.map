% For a build-system implemented mostly in Lisp it can be
% read directly. When the build system uses scripts in some
% other notation a simple Lisp program can read this and re-print
% it in whatever form that other system requires, be that shell
% scripts, fragments of a Makefile or whatever.

% Each REDUCE package lines in a sub-directory of the "packages"
% directory. In many cases the name of this sub-directory is the same
% as the name of the package, but sometimes it makes sense to organise
% several packages in one directory or to use a sub-directory structure.
% The list here lists every REDUCE package and explicitly gives the
% location where its source files live.

% When REDUCE is built the first step is to create a "core" system that
% contains all those things needed to build later packages. In an ideal
% this core would be as small as possible, but it is also the case that
% the "core" represents the parts of REDUCE that are pre-loaded at the
% start of any run - and so for historical reasons the set of packages
% included in it give a system rather similar to a very very old version
% of the whole system.
% In this list, packages that are part of the core are tagged as such,
% and they appear in the list on the order they should be built in.

% Packages that are not tagged as "core" ought ideally to be independently
% builable using just the core system. At present this is not the case and
% while building some packages load others. But the list here is ordered
% so that no package should try to load anything that has not appeared
% earlier in the list.

% Many packages have a test script alongside their source. For a package
% called xxx the test script should be "xxx.tst" and a file "xxx.rlg"
% should be reference output from running it.

% In principle there could be modules that were only to be built on the
% CSL or only on the PSL version, and so I tag each with something that
% indicates which they are relevant for. But if you find a module which
% is NOT for use with both at least beware!
