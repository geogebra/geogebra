      Parent package for common numerical analysis procedures, including root finding,
      function interpolation and integration. Note that the optimization (i.e. minimization
      and maximization) is a huge separate top package, despite it also operate on functions
      as defined by this top-level package.

    <p>
      Functions interfaces are intended to be implemented by user code to represent their
      domain problems. The algorithms provided by the library will then operate on these
      function to find their roots, or integrate them, or ... Functions can be multivariate
      or univariate, real vectorial or matrix valued, and they can be differentiable or not.
